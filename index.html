          <h2>Llamas</h2>
            <p>The llama is a quadriped that lives in big rivers like the Amazon. It has two ears, a heart, a forehead, and a beak for eating honey. It is provided with fins for swimming. Llamas are bigger than frogs.</p>
            
            <p>Llamas are very dangerous, and should you see one where people are swimming, you must shout out: "Look out, there are llamas!"</p>
